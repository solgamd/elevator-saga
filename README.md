#Challenge to the MAX!

- 1. Create a new Github repo

- 2. Try and solve as much of elevatorsaga as you can using the prompts and api documentation.

- 3. Each solution to a given challenge # in elevatorsaga should be tagged as a release in your repo.  The hope is your solution can solve each challenge as one large program, not lots of smaller programs.

- 4. Please do not cheat, don’t copy or reference pre-written solutions from other people, etc ( we can tell ).  Normal Googling is fine of course.  We’re not expecting you to beat the whole thing in 4 hours, it’s more important for us to see how you approach the problem at various stages and so on.
